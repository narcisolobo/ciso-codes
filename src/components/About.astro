      I&rsquo;m building a modern web development training program for
      underserved communities. This GoFundMe helps cover living expenses while I
      work on the curriculum <strong>before funding is finalized</strong>.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-orange-100 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Your support allows me to stay focused on designing a meaningful, scalable
      program that helps people break into tech and build better futures.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-orange-100 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Studies consistently show that more diverse teams are more innovative and
      productive. When we invest in inclusive training programs, we&rsquo;re not
      just changing livesâ€”we&rsquo;re building a better industry.

      Every contribution helps bridge the gap and bring this vision to life.
